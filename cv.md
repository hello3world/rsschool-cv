## About Me

I have experience in the development of educational projects using the technologies indicated in the skillset section. Currently, I systematically improve my skills on new educational projects. In the short term of my development, I plan to learn the React framework. In the future, I see myself as a fullstack developer with node.js for backend.

Development has attracted me all my adult life with the opportunity to create complex, unique things and things that are useful to people. Now I have fully devoted myself to this matter in order to change my professional activity as soon as possible.

In my current job, I often have to take the initiative by following implicit orders. In the future, I would prefer to work in a team with clearer instructions. In dealing with people, I value respect for personal boundaries and a sense of humor.
