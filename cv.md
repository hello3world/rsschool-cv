## About Me

I am 30. I am an energy engineer. All 9 years of work in the power industry, I diligently acquired new
knowledge and approached the performance of my duties responsibly. Now I know the entire technological
chain of electricity production from a light bulb in an apartment to a power plant. With great knowledge
came the realization that my resource in the profession was exhausted. If I don’t continue to develop further in my own way, then in a few years I will hate my job. Why did I choose frontend? I tried many directions in search of my
new recognition, but when I started to make the layout of the site, I realized that it calms and inspires
me. With these I am entering a new profession and I plan to reach great heights, and maybe even write my
name in the history of Belarusian IT)
