## About Me

I have experience in the development of educational projects using the technologies indicated in the skillset section. Currently, I systematically improve my skills on new educational projects. In the short term of my development, I plan to learn the React framework. In the future, I see myself as a fullstack developer with node.js for backend.

Development has attracted me all my adult life with the opportunity to create complex, unique things and things that are useful to people. Now I have fully devoted myself to this matter in order to change my professional activity as soon as possible.

In my current job, I often have to take the initiative by following implicit orders. In the future, I would prefer to work in a team with clearer instructions. In dealing with people, I value respect for personal boundaries and a sense of humor.

## Code Examples

**Combine objects KATA from CODEWARS:** _Your task is to write a function that takes two or more objects and returns a new object which combines all the input objects. All input object properties will have only numeric values. Objects are combined together so that the values of matching keys are added together._

```javascript
function combine(){
  let comboObj = {};
  for(let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++){
    for(let key in arguments[i]){
      if(!comboObj[key]){
      comboObj[key] = arguments[i][key];
      }
      else {
        comboObj[key] += arguments[i][key];
      }
    }
  }
return comboObj;
}
```
